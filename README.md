**Home of Network Protcol Data Exfiltration Project (NPDEP)**

Data exfiltration poses a significant threat.

The loss of important data can lead an organization into an existential crisis.

Especially the exfiltration via network protocol is a way to transfer large amounts of data and was used by 
different threat actors in the past.

In this regard, this project aims to provide various data exfiltration scenarios through a modular approach, to enable 
defenders to gain a comprehensive understanding of data exfiltration via network protocol in order to develop targeted 
detection and defense measures.

Please note, that all the tools developed and made available through this account may only be used for academic purposes 
or with consent and are only intended for defensive purposes in order to evaluate your own security measures.
